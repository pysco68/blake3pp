# Fully static aarch64 release toolchain: zig's clang targeting
# aarch64-linux-musl. No glibc version coupling and no dynamic loader, so
# the binary runs on any Linux kernel of the last decade. Runtime SIMD
# dispatch keeps working because blake3pp's dispatch is a plain cpuid +
# function-pointer table by design; it never uses GNU ifunc, which does
# not survive static linking.
#
# Requires the zig binary on PATH or via $ZIG (see tools/zig-wrappers/).
